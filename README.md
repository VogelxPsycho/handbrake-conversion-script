# handbrake-conversion-script
A script to recursively (depth 1) go through a media library and convert the files to h.265 with HandBrakeCLI

I added comments to every line in the script to explain what it does, and to make sure you know what to adjust and how to adjust it. If you're planning on using this script please make sure to read through it and adjust the variables for your personal preference/setup. You will need bash and HandBrakeCLI.
